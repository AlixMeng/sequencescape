You now have an endpoint (under app/api/endpoints), an I/O class (under app/api/io), a module for extending the
behaviour of your model (under app/api/model_extensions) and a feature (under features/api).  You should review
the contents of these files and ensure that they are appropriate, specifically:

* Associations have been automatically added to the endpoint code, so please check the app/api/endpoints file.
* Review the mapping from the Ruby model to JSON, and vice-verse, in the app/api/io file.
* Ensure that your model includes the model extension module
* Update the JSON in the various scenarios in the Cucumber feature.

Hopefully it'll be obvious when you look at the files!
